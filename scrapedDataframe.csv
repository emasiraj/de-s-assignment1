0,"Hotel Danieli was unlike any other hotel we've ever stayed in! Its classic and elegant look was so well preserved. Customer service was unmatched! It is located 1 minute away from San Marco, which makes it very convenient for late nights!"
1,"+We were in Venice for the Carnival and a Masked Ball. Everything humanly possible to influence was wonderful. We could not fault the hotel, its wonderful staff or Venice itself..
-Well, coming home to the coronavirus situation and being quarantined because I had a slight cough that arose in N Italy wasn't great ; but that really wasn't anyone at the hotel's fault!."
2,"+Bed was comfy, beautifully furnished, lovely bathroom, excellent location, nice lounge bar. A great place to enjoy the Venice Carnival..
-Check in took awhile but they upgraded me to apologise.."
3,"-Was sent to another building, not the main one. Didnt like it. The main building is much prettier.."
4,"+One of our favourite hotels. excellent breakfast, attentive staff and a wonderful atmosphere..
-There was nothing that we didn't like about this stay.."
5,"+The magnificent building, the luxury, the friendliness of the staff. The bed was extremely comfortable! They made our stay memorable!.
-Nothing. Everything was perfect!."

7,This was (is) a fabulous hotel with outstanding levels of service and staff attention to detail all of which is wrapped up in the most magical backdrop that is Venice. I/we can't wait to visit again soon ...
8,"Great, very helpful staff. Wonderful historical building. Amazing rooftop view.

9,The main building was built in 1492 it had character rarely seen the bed was very comfortable and the staff was very friendly the downside it was loud and you need eat plugs to take a nap.Also the heating and cooling is a little hard to control
10,"Our stay was not at the level of a Luxury Hotel. Much attention is need for the comfort of the room and cleanliness. For the tired traveler, comfort and the value in the 5 star restaurant are paramount."
11,"Most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed. I am 74 and the thoughtfulness was without limits.
A beautiful property. Best location."
12,"Very nice place. We stayed here for 5 nights and had a great photoshoot here with guys from Orbis. Very picturesque and historic hotel. Recommend Hotel Daniele!

14,"Danieli is THE hotel in Venice. Classic, right next to San Marco, best view of Venice, charming, luxury, calm. Creates memory"
15,"The room was beautiful, quiet and had an amazing view. Staff gave us excellent recommendations for places to eat. Staff were also helpful with rain gear to deal with high tide. Would absolutely stay here again!"
16,"We enjoyed Danieli for the ‚ÄúAfternoon Tea time‚Äù. Reservation was smooth and friendly with the help of Martina. We had the chance to visit the ‚ÄúTerrazza Danieli‚Äù on the roof which was amazing, then we relaxed in Bar Dandolo for the tea. The service was great and the food outstanding. Will be back and would recommend for sure!

17,Lovely historical buildings in a fantastic location. Service and room were both excellent. Breakfast was good but not exceptional.
18,"A hotel that helps a colleague make a mistake. This family was good in all aspects of the evaluation and chose this family. The hotel's been making good comments. Nice position, too! Good recommendation!"
19,-The room too small for 3 adults: I was expecting an upgrade as they did To a friend of mine who was Aline..
20,This is splendid historic building and all the pros and cons follow from this. Don't expect too much.
21,"The hotel is besides doges palace in Venice of beautiful architectural beauty and out side color makes pretty with great service and luxery and historical built near canal water ..The vast lobby and terrace for full view of canal boating ‚Ä¶

24,"The hotel is beautiful or was at one time. It needs a major renovation of rooms. They are dated, dusty and dirty feeling. The lobby is amazing and the location. They either need to renovate or lower pricing"
25,"This is a classic top hotel experience. The proximity to St Marks and the Doges was about as close as you can get but not noisy. Of course, the price is the highest Ive ever paid but was a one night add on to our tour."
26,"Luxury hotel in heart of venice. Amazing terrace.
Óóì"
27,"From the moment you enter the beautiful lobby, you are treated as if you are a guest in their home. The exquisite decor made me just look around in awe. The service could not have been any better!"
28,A historic place with the historically aging hotel. Staffs were friendly and experienced professionals. Hotel was in a bad shape needs to be refreshed. Bathroom was aged and not up to date luxury bathroom. Over all not clean.
29,We booked this as the last night of our honeymoon on points and got a suite upgrade as well. The room was so spacious and breathtaking views of the lagoon. The bed is ridiculously comfortable.
30,perfect place to stay as its commanding position gives best access to the city. The property and staff are first class. A place to stay where you are made to feel very special
31,Hotel Danieli is fantastic! Everything from its location to its customer service and ambiance is amazing
32,"Everything was perfect, thank you so much for talking care of our family's stay. We had 3 beautiful rooms/suites for 2 nights."
33,"Great customer experience. Looking forward to returning. This hotel is in the best location in Venice. Love everything about this place. The restaurant on the roof top is AMAZING.

34,"Who would believe a five star luxury hotel would turn off the air conditioning in the middle of a heat wave just because it is their custom to turn on the heat in October. We were always too hot in our room and opening windows to sleep, which we had to do, led to multiple big bites. Hotel Danieli shame on you!"
35,"Rooftop is nice for afternoon drinks but the bar closes at 6. View is great. Staff could be a lot friendlier.

36,"Hotel Daniela has a great history and an amazing location. The facilities need to be updated though as the AC barely worked, it was impossible to get ‚Äúwarm‚Äù water .. was only hot or cold and it was overpriced to have these issues"
37,Wonderful hotel! Staying here is like a fairy tale - a great place to escape from reality!
38,"Super Luxury and the most amazing service. Make sure that you know some Italian as it is the way to have people go over the edge with great service for you. They give you a trip to the Murano Island and they want you to buy something. ‚Ä¶

39,"The perfect place to stay in Venice, in the heart of the town a palace away from the noisy tourists , best view from the Terazza for the sunset and a feeling of Venetian opulence in the rooms, add a Vivaldi symphony and you‚Äôll get close to perfection ..."
40,The Daniel has the superb location....but the facility is old and the concierges are not so knowledgeable. It does not worth for the cost.
41,"The hotel is pretty, but it is also pretty old. It is in need of some updating as well as a change of staff who have hospitality training. There are some much much nicer hotels with far better service. Additionally, the concierge had no meaningful recommendations

42,"The room opened to an inner dark courtyard, at this price I wouldn't have taken it out if I knew in advance that I had to look at the wall of a neighbor in Venice"
43,Location is exceptional and the lobby is beautiful but the room was very disappointing as it was very dated (wardrobe furniture even damaged). mediocre service. Poor value for money
44,"This hotel was far below my expectations. I have stayed at many luxury collection hotels and this hotel did not come close in comparison. For the price, I would never recommend it"
45,"Very good location, warm-hearted staff, good food and good service, best view at the terrace restaurant.
For sure I will go back here next time."
46,"Overall a top rate experience. Excellent service, large room, and helpful concierge. The location and amenities were perfect. Check in and out was quick and easy."
47,"This may be the finest hotel in the world. You are literally staying in a museum. The staff was equally amazing. If you stay here definitely include the breakfast. It's on the roof and a professional falcon keeps the seagulls away.

48,"Gracious place to stay in when you are in the amazing city of Venezia. The room is very comfortable with a dressing room üòª and lots of lights in the bathroom üõÅ. The room was quite antique and didn‚Äôt have a shower just bathtub.
The whole hotel is fantastic and you feel as if you are living some centuries back.

49,"Hotel was not well maintained. Staff was not helpful and not attentive at all, just standing and chatting. I respect history that they carry, but unfortunately they are in name only. Only good thing is that their location. You do not get what you paid for. Do not stay double room, the room looks like roof space..."
50,Amazing!!! It has always been my wish if I visit Venice to stay at this hotel. It‚Äôs outstanding! You can‚Äôt beat the location! Best view of Venice from the restaurants terrace! So much history and art! Loved it!!! Thank you Danieli!

52,Centrally located hotel with views taken from history books. Restaurants of all types within minutes of walking with great shops along the way. Best staff I've experienced in a long time and took the time to care about my stay. Great lobby to share drinks before heading out. Looking forward to my next stay.
53,"Very accommodating! Beautiful Victorian style hotel.

54,"This is our 3rd stay at Danieli, a beautiful iconic hotel. Our large room balcony overlooking the Grand Canal exceptional. The breakfast buffet on the huge outdoor balcony delicious and wonderful. Location near San Marco the best!"
55,Very nice and music very nice as well
56,"... best place so close to Piazza San Marco in Venezia ...

57,Beautiful and cozy. We had a wonderful room in the old building overlooking Canal grande.
58,Historic Architecture is great. Would be great to have an exclusive transfer from airport to hotel for arrival. This would make hotel stand out. Live music in lobby in evenings would be a nice touch.
59,"Walking through Riva Degli Schiavoni in Venice, between Piazza San Marco and San Zaccheria, here is an elegant red color, the famous and luxurious Hotel Danieli inside Palazzo Dandolo, opposite the Grand Canal. All wonderful.

66,"Beautiful hotel in the center of Venezia. Not only the service is superb, the design of the place is breathtaking.
For Italy, this is an amazing customer experience."
67,The hotel is beautiful but I think their food and readtaurant prices are too high and dont match realistically.
68,"Everything from start to finish was wonderful! Easy access, close to historical sites to visit"
69,"Hotel Danieli has a great location, but I would not consider it to be a 5 star hotel."
70,Comfortable and cosy old themed hotel
71,"The hotel staff is unprofessional and rude, especially the concierge. He distorted my mood by his disgusting behavior and made me cry on my birthday. We were guests of the hotel restaurant for a dinner. Besides the hotel staff, the palace is beautiful.

72,Great hotel.very nice staff. Top restaurant
73,The Danieli is a fantastic hotel. The d√©cor is classical Venice. The staff is fantastic. Dining in the Terrazza Danieli is a must. We had dinner and breakfast there with amazing views of Venice and wonderful food and wine.
74,"Gorgeous historic luxury hotel! I highly recommend this place!

75,A wonderful experience in the middle of one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Extremely well located. Great experience. Nothing better than having dinner at sunsets on top of the Danieli

77,"A suite on the lagoon. Devine is the only way to describe the place. Even in the face of 120 cm (4ft) flood water this place has the grace and panache to endure. They take care of details, they do it old school and it's a fabulous thing. ‚Ä¶

82,The service is poor. The view and the location save almost all.
83,"If you‚Äôre looking for a real Venetian experience, this is the place to go. The ambience and service were wonderful, the people friendly and polite."

87,I have been to Danieli many times for lunch and drinks but this time I had the opportunity to stay at the hotel. It was all that I expected. The rooms are still quite large. Everyone is very helpful and their experience helped to recommend so many new things for us this trip.

89,for such a luxury hotel the staff behaviour was poor (the concierge entered our room without notice) also the room suffered many problems - the water temperature setting in the shower was not working power was off during the day time of the 2nd day of staybreakfast is very limited and does not present the expected quality

94,"i brought my wife to venice to show her the beauty of that city and the Danieli made that trip a complete success for style,location and atmosphere.."
95,The Danieli is an incredible hotel. Full luxury hotel with an incredible atmosphere and 6 star service. Unique architecture that e uses Venice. The view from the terrace bar and restaurant is stunning. One of my all time favorite hotels.
96,"GREAT HOTEL ,WE LOVED OUR SUIET ON THE SECOND FLOOR,GOOD BREAKFAST AND SERVICE
,BEST LOCATION !!!"
97,"Unreal, amazing building in an excellent location. Rooftop restaurant has spectacular views. Top tier staff and everything is what you'd expect
Óóì"
98,Venice is expensive. But we travel in the luxury and ultra luxury class often. The hotel has an historic Lobby and a beautiful rooftop view. But the rooms are quite tight for a 1300 eu price tag. they are too busy and large a hotel to provide the personal attention a boutique luxury hotel does.
99,Go there you‚Äôll love it!!!
100,Ambiance in old Palace. Good location. Great rooftop dining.
