0,Hotel Arena, Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful ,positive
1,Hotel Arena, I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer ,negative
2,Hotel Arena, No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,positive
3,Hotel Arena, Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back ,positive
4,Hotel Arena, Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge ,negative
5,Hotel Arena, Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character ,positive
6,Hotel Arena, My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep ,negative
7,Hotel Arena, Amazing location and building Romantic setting ,positive
8,Hotel Arena, You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again ,negative

17,Hotel Arena, The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night ,negative
18,Hotel Arena, Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too ,positive
19,Hotel Arena, Nothing all great ,negative
20,Hotel Arena, Style location rooms,positive
21,Hotel Arena, 6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260 ,negative

25,Hotel Arena, It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it ,positive
26,Hotel Arena, The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him ,negative
27,Hotel Arena, This hotel is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good ,positive
28,Hotel Arena, Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic ,positive
29,Hotel Arena, Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse,negative
30,Hotel Arena, We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland ,positive
31,Hotel Arena, We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment ,negative
32,Hotel Arena, Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues ,positive
33,Hotel Arena, I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee ,positive
34,Hotel Arena, We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely ,negative
35,Hotel Arena, Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area ,positive
36,Hotel Arena, Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit ,negative
37,Hotel Arena, The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ,positive
38,Hotel Arena, Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery ,negative
39,Hotel Arena, The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable ,positive
40,Hotel Arena, Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing ,negative
41,Hotel Arena, Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly ,positive
42,Hotel Arena, Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner ,negative
43,Hotel Arena, Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning ,positive

46,Hotel Arena, The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv ,negative
47,Hotel Arena, The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around ,positive
48,Hotel Arena, Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all ,negative
49,Hotel Arena, Great hotel original concept style,positive
50,Hotel Arena, Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you ,negative
51,Hotel Arena, The hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits ,positive
52,Hotel Arena, We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom ,negative

57,Hotel Arena, Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern ,positive
58,Hotel Arena, Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective ,negative
59,Hotel Arena, Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums ,negative
60,Hotel Arena, The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible ,positive
61,Hotel Arena, Please see above,negative
62,Hotel Arena, The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing,positive
63,Hotel Arena, The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two ,negative
64,Hotel Arena, Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great ,positive

66,Hotel Arena, the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park,positive
67,Hotel Arena, not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation,negative
68,Hotel Arena, Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ,positive
69,Hotel Arena, The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more ,negative
70,Hotel Arena, The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,positive
71,Hotel Arena, the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that,negative
72,Hotel Arena, Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good ,positive
73,Hotel Arena, Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet ,negative
74,Hotel Arena, The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything ,positive
75,Hotel Arena, Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy ,negative
76,Hotel Arena, Nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous ,positive
77,Hotel Arena, Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate ,negative
78,Hotel Arena, Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk ,positive
79,Hotel Arena, Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again ,negative

81,Hotel Arena, Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that ,negative

85,Hotel Arena, Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either ,negative
86,Hotel Arena, Massive bed,positive
87,Hotel Arena, The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else ,negative
88,Hotel Arena, The hotel looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in ,positive
89,Hotel Arena, The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups ,negative
90,Hotel Arena, The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone ,positive
91,Hotel Arena, clean and new,positive
92,Hotel Arena, Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here,negative
93,Hotel Arena, My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night ,positive
94,Hotel Arena, The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam ,negative
95,Hotel Arena, The location and views ,positive
96,Hotel Arena, When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all ,negative
97,Hotel Arena, The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat,positive
98,Hotel Arena, I loved everything ,negative

107,Hotel Arena, The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really ,positive
108,Hotel Arena, The hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference ,negative

110,Hotel Arena, The property is beautiful,positive
111,Hotel Arena, The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management ,negative

130,Hotel Arena, The building was fantastic All renovated areas were very stylish The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place ,positive
131,Hotel Arena, The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price ,negative

138,Hotel Arena, Lovely hotel with lots of history Great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bed,positive
139,Hotel Arena, If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast ,negative
140,Hotel Arena, The whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly The dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well The room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again ,positive

147,Hotel Arena, The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel ,positive
148,Hotel Arena, The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money ,negative
149,Hotel Arena, Beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel Especially the hall to our room ,positive
150,Hotel Arena, I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy ,negative
151,Hotel Arena, We like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere Of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc ,positive
152,Hotel Arena, The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel ,negative
153,Hotel Arena, The room was lovely great hotel beautiful location ,positive

161,Hotel Arena, Pretty building interesting rooms ,positive
162,Hotel Arena, Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait ,negative

167,Hotel Arena, Large bed ,positive
168,Hotel Arena, Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done ,negative
169,Hotel Arena, It s a beautiful hotel or should I say will be when the renovation is finished ,positive
170,Hotel Arena, The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere ,negative
171,Hotel Arena, Good location Cheap ,positive
172,Hotel Arena, In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair ,negative
173,Hotel Arena, Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion ,positive
174,Hotel Arena, So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms,negative
175,Hotel Arena, Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast ,positive
176,Hotel Arena, There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas ,negative
177,Hotel Arena, Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center ,positive
178,Hotel Arena, The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate ,negative
179,Hotel Arena, We upgraded to a larger room Had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds ,positive
180,Hotel Arena, A very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location Bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding ,positive
181,Hotel Arena, Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout ,negative
182,Hotel Arena, Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend ,negative
183,Hotel Arena, beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the hotel is really different,positive
184,Hotel Arena, split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing ,negative
185,Hotel Arena, Location,positive
186,Hotel Arena, Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud,negative
187,Hotel Arena, Location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll ,positive
188,Hotel Arena, Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought,negative
189,Hotel Arena, The bed was amazing Actually our whole room large room The park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven ,positive
190,Hotel Arena, There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant ,negative

206,Hotel Arena, there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view,negative
207,Hotel Arena, Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots ,positive
208,Hotel Arena, Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant ,negative
209,Hotel Arena, Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,positive

211,Hotel Arena, This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel ,positive
212,Hotel Arena, Very friendly staff lovely comfy room,positive
213,Hotel Arena, We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel ,negative

219,Hotel Arena, the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware ,negative

223,Hotel Arena, Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend ,negative
224,Hotel Arena, The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level ,negative

226,Hotel Arena, The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small ,negative
227,Hotel Arena, this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,positive
228,Hotel Arena, Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed,negative
229,Hotel Arena, Liked the staff The location,positive
230,Hotel Arena, The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central,negative

245,Hotel Arena, Good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history ,positive
246,Hotel Arena, It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished ,negative
247,Hotel Arena, Comfy beds we upgraded to a suite which was very spacious with a bath staff lovely all speak English restaurant food exceptional and great choice at breakfast Tram stops right outside and next to a lovely park,positive
248,Hotel Arena, First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all ,negative
249,Hotel Arena, Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms ,negative

277,Hotel Arena, There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major ,negative

289,Hotel Arena, Average good accommodation Big room Helpful staff Room cleaned daily Big hot shower Comfy bed ,positive
290,Hotel Arena, Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly ,negative

292,Hotel Arena, The first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom I raised this with the staff and was given another room However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets They just come make ur bed that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where I could see the toilet from the bed Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid ,negative

319,Hotel Arena, Hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent ,negative
320,Hotel Arena, The decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredible,positive
321,Hotel Arena, the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking,negative
322,Hotel Arena, The hotel is amazing Beautiful interior We weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof Our room was fantastic the only thing I should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc The room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush ,positive

333,Hotel Arena, They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back,negative
334,Hotel Arena, The bedrooms were pleasnt the bed was really comfy It was nice the shower was clean I enjoyed my room Wasn t allowed to check in till 3 but managed to get us a room by 2ish which was good ,positive
335,Hotel Arena, When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts ,negative
336,Hotel Arena, The room was pleasant We liked the big bathroom and the bed was large and extremely comfortable The mini fridge safe tv s with English channels and the ability to make drink were pluses,positive
337,Hotel Arena, Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting ,negative
338,Hotel Arena, Nice comfy and cosy rooms with very big windows so there is plenty of light A lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction ,positive

344,Hotel Arena, Location was close enough to anything we needed hotel was big clean spacious rooms and nice bar with friendly staff at a very good price would happily stay again,positive
345,Hotel Arena, Breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a Gym Swimming pool,negative
346,Hotel Arena, Polite staff ,positive
347,Hotel Arena, The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel ,negative
348,Hotel Arena, The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam ,positive
349,Hotel Arena, The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult ,negative
350,Hotel Arena, nothing,positive
351,Hotel Arena, the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again ,negative
352,Hotel Arena, Staff was vey pleasant The place is very well designed,positive
353,Hotel Arena, In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena,negative
354,Hotel Arena, Location is good it takes 20 mins by feet and 10 15 mins by tram to get to the city center ,positive
355,Hotel Arena, Arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathroom No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No minibar in room only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a 3 hotel only ,negative

357,Hotel Arena, Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful ,negative

361,Hotel Arena, No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine ,negative
362,Hotel Arena, staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked ,positive
363,Hotel Arena, the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants ,negative
364,Hotel Arena, The hall,positive
365,Hotel Arena, The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel ,negative

369,Hotel Arena, Very beautiful building cozy room cool bar ,positive
370,Hotel Arena, Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please ,negative
371,Hotel Arena, Staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena,positive
372,Hotel Arena, Close to Tram Excellent room nice staff ,positive
373,Hotel Arena, Taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train Breakfast was nice but very expensive ,negative
374,Hotel Arena, Renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the room They dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you ,negative
375,Hotel Arena, Good Wi fi ,positive
376,Hotel Arena, The room wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times ,negative

378,Hotel Arena, The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received ,positive
379,Hotel Arena, At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked ,negative
380,Hotel Arena, Character of the hotel was great Location was good,positive
381,Hotel Arena, Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc ,negative
382,Hotel Arena, Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel ,positive
383,Hotel Arena, The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great ,positive
384,Hotel Arena, The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future ,negative
385,Hotel Arena, Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had ,negative
386,Hotel Arena, friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sins,positive

396,Hotel Arena, The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect ,positive
397,Hotel Arena, Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all ,negative
398,Hotel Arena, Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction ,positive

404,Hotel Arena, I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable ,positive
405,Hotel Arena, The bed was comfy and large The wifi was fast and good Separate living area Powerful shower,positive
406,Hotel Arena, Iron wasn t very good Bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it Building works took away from quality of hotel We didn t like they reserved 150 on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done,negative

412,Hotel Arena, Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes ,positive

897,K K Hotel George, The beds and decor were nice It was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night We chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation Extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request ,positive
898,K K Hotel George, The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better ,negative

1149,K K Hotel George, The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price ,negative

1155,K K Hotel George, We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor ,negative

1165,K K Hotel George, On this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny The d cor was OK perhaps functional is an apt description There was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to Earls Court station was ideal ,positive
1166,K K Hotel George, On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show ,negative

1706,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The rooms were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room The walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better ,negative

1722,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Rooms are quiet Beds are huge Bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful Location is very good Thames within walking distance Temple area is beautiful Note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud ,positive

1738,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this ,negative
1739,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries ,positive

4282,The Park Grand London Paddington, They must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night Indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in Not a real negative but after a hard day working in London after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then Room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which I had to do since the signal was poor However it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter They seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard Room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all There was a small long thin vase with 2 real Carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as I tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk I mopped the water with a towel btw The Air Con was making a racket so I turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless Despite consuming several pints at the Mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length I only got 3hrs sleep But I don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs I was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms During checkout I wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it Room 114 guys beware ,negative

4439,The Park Grand London Paddington, To all weary travellers I booked a four night stay at The Park Grand hotel in London Paddington Having just arrived from a long journey and I checked into my room and went straight to bed Not long after drifting off to the land of nod I awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms Upon further inspection I soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders I counted in the double digits After contacting reception I was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation By this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump The manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway The following morning I spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit The manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which I did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways At one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that I may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury This certainly did put me at ease and I did not feel like a valued customer Instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay I requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights As anticipated I was told that I should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so I had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel I short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful ,negative

4495,The Park Grand London Paddington, This hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation However given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air Mid januari in London that is not nice We called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction However they told us not being able to repair it until next day ,negative

4534,The Park Grand London Paddington, Air conditioning wasn t great Where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror You had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug The mirror pulled out an angle to the bed The mattress was 2 smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time The shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room Whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark Didn t like the fact I had to hand over photo ID and the Receptionist was unable to answer why when I asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why She took my credit card to confirm I was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any ID and what if I didn t have ID would I not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room Not happy about this information being available hence why I requested the copy back on departure Small Bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages ,negative

4646,The Park Grand London Paddington, The bathroom If it can be called that even Honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower We had to put down 3 towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room It was really very tiny though we were in the Club Room ,negative

4667,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was tiny To put this into perspective we are two 30 yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury I ve also been in London a number of times so I understand hotel rooms are small in general Knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it We actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room ,negative

4670,The Park Grand London Paddington, Reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful I feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only 9 not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual London cabs etc We booked a room for 3 people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa Also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them I wouldn t trust them again with my credit card ,negative

4690,The Park Grand London Paddington, I booked a double deluxe room here online but when I got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though I had paid the price point for a double deluxe room 450 pounds a night They then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures Staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional For 450 pounds night 800 Canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here I felt like I had thrown a bunch of money down the drain ,negative
4691,The Park Grand London Paddington, The staff were all polite helpful and friendly We stayed in a Junior Suite and the room was everything you would want if away from all home comforts really comfortable and in a quiet location considering it s London The breakfast was excellent plentiful and tasty Would definitely stay there again ,positive

4697,The Park Grand London Paddington, Reception was a nightmare When we arrived they put into a room which NOT what we ordered and they were more concerned with taking our money than providing a service Treated us like B grade guests because we had booked using Booking com We asked them to book a taxi for us on departure and they booked a cab for the wrong time Would not stay there again ,negative

4702,The Park Grand London Paddington, Location ,positive
4703,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was a Club It was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed Anyone more than 6ft 3 tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height The bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room The mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable 2 nights sleep Overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth As a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere ,negative
4704,The Park Grand London Paddington, The location is good everything is nice and handy to get to from this Hotel which is it s only saving grace in my opinion ,positive
4705,The Park Grand London Paddington, We had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view Then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose The room was smaller than we expected to get for the 436 we paid for the two nights Also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded All in all definitely not worth the money we paid ,negative

4711,The Park Grand London Paddington, We had the benefit of being upgraded because of a broken shower in the room originally booked Excellent indian restaurant very friendly and normally helpful staff good continental breakfast for a good price Large number of staff Lot of storage room due to clever use of space ,positive
4712,The Park Grand London Paddington, A room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests Neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name This lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting Instead it was sent back by the receptionist ,negative

4730,The Park Grand London Paddington, The location 10 mins walk from rail station and tube station and the Hilton hotel Two tips our booking is not free cancelled one so the hotel charged all the fee before arriving No slippers The shower is good ,positive
4731,The Park Grand London Paddington, The size of the room is definitely smaller than the description Befor arriving they informed us that the room we booked had something wrong so they will transfer us to their sister hotel which is two minutes walk We rejected and the first night they arranged us to a room at basement floor which was horriable I think it is because of overbook The hotel is not very clean And at the 7th day the toilet flush button also didn t work well ,negative
